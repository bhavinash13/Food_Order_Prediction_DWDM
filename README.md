**Food Order Prediction DWDM Team Project**

*INTRODUCTION*
Background: In today’s food industry, restaurants and delivery platforms face challenges in anticipating 
what customers will order. This unpredictability affects inventory, staff management, and 
customer satisfaction.
Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model that predicts a customer’s next food order using factors such as 
past orders, cuisine preferences, time of day, and location.
Motivation:
 • Reduce food waste and manage kitchen inventory efficiently.
 • Enable faster preparation and smarter staffing.
 • Deliver personalized recommendations and improve user satisfaction.
 
*PROPOSED SYSTEM*
Approach:
 • A supervised ML model (Random Forest) that predicts what food a 
customer is likely to order based on location, time, past orders, cuisine 
preference, and order frequency.
 • The model learns customer patterns to forecast future choices and improve 
order accuracy.
How It’s Better:
 • Uses multiple real-world features for smarter predictions.
 • High accuracy and reduced overfitting with Random Forest.
 • Helps restaurants forecast demand and manage stock.
 • Provides personalized recommendations for users.
 • Scalable for integration with food delivery or restaurant 
systems.

*DATASET DESCRIPTION*
Data Source:
 Synthetic dataset generated using Python (5,000 records).
 Features / Attributes:
 • Location
 • Time of Day
 • Previous Order
 • Preferred Cuisine
 • Order Frequency
 • Food Item (Target)
 
*DATA PREPROCESSING*
1. Data Cleaning:
 • Removed missing values
 • Fixed inconsistencies
 2. Feature Selection / Encoding:
 • Label Encoding for categorical 
columns
 • StandardScaler for normalization
 • Split data: 80% Train, 20% Test

*MODEL AND ALGORITHM*
Algorithm Used:  Random Forest Classifier
Why This Algorithm:
 • High accuracy for classification
 • Handles categorical + numerical data well
 • Avoids overfitting
Normalization / Splitting:
 • Data scaled using StandardScaler
 • Train-Test split (80-20)
 
*RESULTS AND EVALUATION*
 Accuracy / Metrics:
 Accuracy: ~90–95%
 Classification Report & Confusion Matrix
 Graphs:
 • Feature Importance Plot
 • Food Orders by Time/Cuisine/Location
 Sample Output:
 Predicted Food Order → “Pizza”
 
*COMPARISON*
With Other Models:
 Model      Accuracy
 Decision Tree    86%
 Logistic Regression   82%
 Random Forest   94%
Performance Summary: Random Forest performed best with balanced precision and recall.

*CONCLUSION*
Every food choice tells a story — and our model learns it.
“We built an intelligent system that helps restaurants prepare better, delivery apps 
recommend smarter, and customers get exactly what they crave — right on time”.
Next, we aim to take this from notebooks to the real world — deploying it as a 
web app powered by real restaurant data.
